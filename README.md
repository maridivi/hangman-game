# Hangman Game

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## Instructions

The game starts with a blank representation of a word, where each blank space represents a letter in the word. Players guess one letter at a time, and if the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position(s).
If the guessed letter is not in the word, one part of the hangman is drawn as a penalty. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly, saving the hangman, or the hangman is fully drawn, indicating the player has run out of guesses and lost the game.
