## Instructions

1. Open the game on your device to be greeted by the medieval-themed introduction screen.
2. Click the "Start Game" button.

3. You will be presented with a series of underscores representing the hidden word you need to guess.
4. Click (or type with keyboard) on the alphabet buttons on the screen to select a letter you believe is in the word.
   If the letter is correct, it will appear in its correct position(s) in the hidden word.
   If incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn, marking one step closer to the hangman's completion.
   Winning the Game: Successfully guess all the letters in the word before the hangman is fully drawn to win.
   Losing the Game: If the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word, the game is over. The correct word will be revealed.
